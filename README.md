This project is a bare, bootstrapping, version of the architecture and libraries that I have been very found of over the past year or so. (2018-2019)
It's also a great demo application for talks about TypeScript or State-flow architecture.

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs Jest tests

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
